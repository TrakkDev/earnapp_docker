# EarnApp Docker
> [!NOTE]
> UNOFFICIAL Docker Image for BrightData's [EarnApp](https://earnapp.com/)

[Dockerhub repository](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/trakkdev/earnapp/general)


## How to start your earnapp docker

> Also works with [docker rootless](https://docs.docker.com/engine/security/rootless/)

### 1. Pull and run

 ```docker run -d --memory="256m" --cpus=1  --restart=always --name earnapp TrakkDev/earnapp:v0.4 ```

And that's all folks

### 2. Register by completing your new node registration link
Register your node to your earnapp account. You can see your UUID in the container logs

 ```https://earnapp.com/r/sdk-node-MY_UUID```

#### 3. (Optional) Set your node ID as environment variable

> Set the node ID in an environment variable named EARNAPP_UUID if you want to reinstall the container with the same node ID

```docker run -d -e EARNAPP_UUID='sdk-node-MY_UUID' --memory="256m" --cpus=1  --restart=always --name earnapp TrakkDev/earnapp:v0.4 ```

## How it works

The docker image is built with a base image of ubuntu and run the install script from earnapp website (wget -qO- https://brightdata.com/static/earnapp/install.sh) 

Then an new node ID (UUID) is generated at start and stored in the earnapp /etc/earnapp/uuid file.
